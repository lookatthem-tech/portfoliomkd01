For this company alone, the API\u00a0references that I\u00a0created include more than 50 pages and 200 endpoints.</p> <p>The following links show you two pages out of the various large API references that I\u00a0created:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Geolocations API</p> </li> <li> <p>Sensors API</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"01ApiAiTools/#api-documentation-and-testing-tools","title":"API documentation and testing tools","text":"<p>For testing APIs and gathering the information for documentation, I have used various tools.

As not all hours are equal, the algorithm used to calculate Fatigue applies different weights to different types of hours.</p> <p>A balanced calendar is an employee's work pattern, which defines what is normal for the employee. It is dynamically assigned to each employee based on the average number of consecutive shifts and average shift duration for the past 8 working weeks.</p> <p>Fatigue hours accumulated in a day can be positive during work-days (i.e., work induces fatigue), and negative during days off (i.e., restorative time reduces fatigue).</p> <p>The fatigue state is more than the result of a single day, as summing up daily fatigue is not accurate since recent events have a stronger impact than events in the distant past.
