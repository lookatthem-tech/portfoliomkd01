# Diagram Examples

These diagrams are not .png or other images. They are created with markdown text, which is then built by python and mkdocs into diagrams.

## Flowcharts

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Start] --> B{Failure?};
  B -->|Yes| C[Investigate...];
  C --> D[Debug];
  D --> B;
  B ---->|No| E[Success!];
```

## Sequence Diagrams

```mermaid

  loop Health
      Terminal->>Terminal: Check for health
  end
  Note right of Terminal: System online
  Terminal-->>Server: Everything is OK

```
